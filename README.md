# Artificial-Intelligence-kNN-with-k-Fold-Cross-Validation
A kNN example with k-fold cross validation

Data Description: Given 800 Data with 5 attribute and 4 label / classes (0,1,2,3)

This is an example of kNN's implementation with k-Fold cross valiadtion with k = 4. The data will be divide 600 for train and 200 for test. The data train and data test will be rotated. So the accuracy will be more reliable
